# Share on Twitter
Automatically share WordPress posts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/). You choose which Post Types are shared. (Sharing can still be disabled on a per-post basis.)

This plugin shares a lot of code with [Share on Mastodon](https://github.com/janboddez/share-on-mastodon) and [Share on Pixelfed](https://github.com/janboddez/share-on-pixelfed) and functions in much the same way.

It does not, however, automatically register itself as a Twitter client when it is first set up: in order to Tweet from your WordPress instance, you will therefore have to sign up as a developer first, and register a new app with read + write access. Only then will you be given a set of API secrets that allow WordPress to post on your behalf.
